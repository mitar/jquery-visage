jQuery Visage
=============

jQuery Visage provides a stable (no partially displayed elements), robust (it
closes when you click close), styleable (CSS), customizable (you can reprogram
many aspects of its behavior) and clean (being an jQuery_ plugin) way to display
a series of images in a lightbox-like way.
